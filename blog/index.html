                        There is a woman outside hanging up clothes while her husband and kids are out of the house.
                        She is a traditional house wife who just wants to escape from the real world to explore nature.
                        She day dreams about nature throughout her day and wishes she can leave the house like her 
                        husband does. She's happy with her lifestyle, but wishes she can explore more.
